This is a simple react application build using react to visualize various path-finding algorithms.
I haven't done much styling in this project so it might look too good but i hope you will like the animations,
this app can be used at https://wonderful-mcclintock-c87d7e.netlify.app/ 

Algorithms used Dijkstra, A-star, DFS, BFS
